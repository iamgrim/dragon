A man has been arrested in connection with an incident in which a coin was 
thrown at England and Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher. The 19-year-old 
was arrested "in or near" Arsenal's Highbury football ground in north 
London during a match with Fulham, Scotland Yard said.

He is being held at Islington police station on suspicion of throwing a
coin on to the pitch during the FA Cup fourth-round tie between Arsenal
and Liverpool on 27 January.
