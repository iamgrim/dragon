 • Any person who leaves a rod and line with bait and hook in the water 
   unattended or so that the person shall be unable at any time exercise 
   sufficient control over said rod and line shall be guilty of an offence.
 • The use of peanuts is not permitted.
 • The use of keepnets is banned for the retention of Carp, Catfish, Pike, 
   Tench and Bream.
 • Live bait fishing is only permitted with fish caught on site
 • All rubbish is to be taken home; any littering will result in an immediate 
   ban without refund of membership.
 • No lighting of fires and no loud playing of radios.
 • All anglers must be in possession of an Environment Agency Rod License(s).
 • In the interest of safety and public liability risk, wading and the use of 
   boats is not allowed without prior agreement from the fishery owner.
 • Swim clearance must be restricted to cutting stems of no more than an inch 
   in thickness without authorisation of the bailiff or fishery owner.
 • There is a baited rod limit of three rods and only designated swims can be 
   fished from, casting only into designated areas. This creates areas of 
   sanctuary which bait boats should not be used to circumvent.
